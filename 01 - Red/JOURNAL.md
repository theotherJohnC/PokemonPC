# Pokemon Red Playthrough Journal
**Start Date:** 12/7/2021  
**Current Goal:** Completed Pokédex  
**Status:** In Progress
## Entry 1 - 12/7/2021
**Badges:** 0  
**Pokédex:** Untracked

Today I started my new save on Pokémon Red. I ordered Red, Blue, and Yellow from eBay and have verified they're genuine, so I'm excited to start this journey on the physical carts using original hardware. The initial goal is going to simply be to complete the Pokédex, and once complete I'll build out the living dex for this cartridge.

I'll be uploading the living dex entries as I grab them, ideally at the end of each day. This may mean some anomalies, such as Kakuna being uploaded but not Weedle, but I'll go back and fill those out as I go. In the end I'll set the End Date once the living dex is complete, both in the PC repository and in the in-game PC system.

Starting off I chose Charmander. I'll come to realize this was a mistake later on, but I made that choice to reflect the decision I made on December 25th, 1998 when I unwrapped my very first clear Gameboy Pocket and my brand new copy of Pokémon Red. To help myself out, I did use Pokémon Blue to go ahead and grab three of the other starters for living dex building later on, as well as two more Charmander. As I perform this playthrough I'll be cheesing my way through Blue to get to Cinnebar Island as quickly as possible to make sure I can transfer over the version exclusives from Blue.

Regarding the mistake of choosing Charmander, I'd forgotten at the time that traded Pokémon become disobedient after lvl10. My intention was to use Bulbasaur against Brock at lvl13 where Bulbasaur would have Vine Whip, but as such that's not a possibility. So far as I can recall, without looking at PokemonDB.com and Bulbapedia.Bulbagarden.net, I won't be running into any other grass types I can use against Brock to have an advantage, nor do I have a fishing rod yet to get any water types. My best strategy, then will be to level up either or both Nidoran to lvl9 where they'll have Double Kick.

## Entry 2 - 12/8/2021
**Badges:** 1  
**Pokédex:** 24

Today was eventful. I made it to Pewter City but spent a lot more time in Viridian Forest both catching everything I could as well as getting everyone in my party up to at least lvl13. Soemthing I didn't realize yesterday when I had my big bright idea of using Double Kick against Brock's rock-types was that Nidoran only learns Double Kick this early in Pokémon Yellow. That said, at lvl13 Charmander was able to beat Geodude and Onix without too much trouble, netting me the badge.

I made my way past Route 3, though Mount Moon, and Route 4 to end up in Cerulean City. Fortunately I caught a Pikachu in Viridian Forest so beating Misty shouldn't take much effort at all. After I get her badge Bulbasaur and Squirtle should start obeying me again so I get them evolved.

At this point I'm catching Pokémon as I train my party but not going out of my way yet to try to catch everything in an area. I'll save that for after I beat the Elite Four and am in endgame. The first five hours have been slow, largely because training low-level Pokémon takes quite a while. Now that everyone is at a decent level and the wild Pokémon are higher leveled, power leveling my team isn't going to be nearly as much of an issue.
