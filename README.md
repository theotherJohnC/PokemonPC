# DARE's Pokémon PC
Welcome! This repo represents the collection of Pokémon I've captured in the pursuit of whatever personal challenges I have placed on myself during my adventures as a Pokémon trainer. Periodically (ideally at the end of each day) I'll copy my save off of the physical cartridge collection I have of each Pokémon game using the GBxCART RW v1.4 or any variety of CFW installed on my DS or Switch, extract the Pokémon using PKHeX, and sync my repository.
## What kind of challenges are you doing?
### The Living Dex - Per Game Set
My very first challenge is to complete a living dex across all of the game sets/pairs. This means having a complete living dex on ONE of the cartridges for each set:
- Red, Blue, or Yellow
- Gold, Silver, or Crystal
- Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald
- Fire Red or Leaf Green
- Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum
- Black or White
- Black 2 or White 2
- X or Y
- Omega Ruby or Alpha Sapphire
- Ultra Sun or Ultra Moon*
- Let's Go Pikachu or Let's Go Eevee
- Sword or Shield
- Brilliant Diamond or Shining Pearl

*Note: I have no intention of buying Sun and Moon, and as such Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon will suffice
### The Living Dex - Per Game
My second challenge will be going back and compiling a living dex on each and every cartridge from Gen 1 onward.
### Other Future Challenges
From where I stand right now the above two challenges will be monumental tasks. Other goals I'd like to evaluate once the above two are complete include, but may ultimately not be limited to:
- A gendered living dex
- A forms living dex
- A gendered forms living dex
- A shiny dex
- A gendered and forms shiny dex (slay me now)
- A nature dex (oof)
- A gendered, forms, and natured dex (OOF)
- A natured shiny dex (WHAT?!)
- A gendered, forms, and natured shiny dex (omg...)
## What are the benefits of using GitHub for this project?
Using GitHub will allow me to best track the capture dates of every Pokémon in a way that'll be easily visualizable as well as give me a place to ensure my work and progress is never lost as I can dump the saves AND upload them here as well. This'll also be the best way to open my dex's up to scrutiny by the public, keeping me honest and providing a way to show off my dex's outside of Pokémon Home.

Plus I don't think Home has enough space to support all of this anyway.
